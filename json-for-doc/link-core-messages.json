SS has the same protocol as OSS and is meant to replace it. SS is faster, more flexible, is better documented and adds a few features:",				"",				"1. #shouldSignal:, which decides if SS should signal low level Socket exceptions (true) or if it should swallow them like original OSS did. Default is true. The only reason I added this is for backwards compatibility - not signalling causes problems - see bug 4 below.",				"",				"2. #nextAllInBuffer, #nextInBuffer:, #skip:, #receiveData:, #nextPutAllFlush: and #recentlyRead are new additions to the public protocol.",				"",				"",				"It also fixes various bugs:",				"",				"1. #isDataAvailable could theoretically answer false, when there actually is some in the buffer in OSS. If #receiveDataIfAvailable reads the last byte then the following \"socket dataAvailable\" would answer false. So the last byte would be sitting in the inStream missed.",				"",				"2. #upToAll: in OSS has several problems, for example - #positionOfSubCollection:ifAbsent: which was introduced answers one position too low. This was compensated in upToAll:, but only in the pushBack: call, not the actual result being returned which was cut short 1 byte. Amusingly this makes KomHttpServer not use \"Keep-Alive\" since the last $e in 'Alive' was cut short. :)",				"",				"3. SS doesn't inherit from PositionableStream since that just breaks various inherited messages, like for example #skip:. OSS should IMHO be changed to inherit from Object - or of course, replaced in full with SS. :)",				"",				"4. Since SocketStream by default signals closes and timeouts the SocketStreamTest now passes. The reason for SocketStream to fail is that while it does timeout on a low level (#SocketStream>>receiveData doesn't hang forever) - the callers of #receiveData sometimes loop - like in #next:, and thus eliminates the timeout. SS warns about some methods (in their method comments) not honouring timeouts if shouldSignal is false, I really don't know what they should do in that case:",				"\t#next:, #upTo:, #upToAll: and #upToEnd (and #receiveData:)",				"",				"",				"The primary reason for the SS implementation is optimal performance. The main differences in implementation with the old OSS are:",				"",				"1. SS uses two buffers directly (inBuffer and outBuffer) with pointers marking start and stop within the buffer. OSS instead uses two regular streams, a ReadStream and a WriteStream. Using internal buffers makes it possible to avoid copying and reallocation in various ways, it also makes SS be able to have specialized growing/buffer moving behaviour.",				"",				"2. #upTo:, #upToAll: and #peekForAll: uses selectged String messages that in turn uses fast primitives for searching. OSS used other messages that fell back on byte per byte reading.",				"",				"3. #receiveData in OSS creates a temporary buffer stream for each call! During a long read operation, like say #upToAll: (which for example is used when uploading files using HTTP POST forms), this is devastating - especially since the default size is only 2000 bytes - and leads to a very high number of low level read operations on the Socket, typically 100 times more calls than with OSS. The buffer in OSS is held in an instvar (not recreated for each call), is larger from the start and above all - grows dynamically by doubling. OSS can also avoid a grow/reallocation by doing a \"move down\" if data has been read from the SS as it comes in and through that making room in the lower part of the inBuffer. The net result is that upToAll: for large files is about 10 times faster.",				"",				"4. The implementation of upTo: and upToAll: tries to avoid doing unnecessary find operations in the buffer and is greedy by default, which means it favors reading more data - if available - before searching for the stop sequence. If we had #findString:startingAt:stoppingAt: this wouldn't have to be greedy and we wouldn't be needlessly scanning dead buffer area. VM hackers? Also, while you are at it - make it work for ByteArrays too. :)",				"",				"",				"SS can not be run unbuffered, since that seems unneeded. The option to autoFlush is still available, with it set to true SocketStream (just like OSS) will flush on its own on each nextPut:/nextPutAll:, otherwise flushing it will have to be done manually but is done on close.",				"",				"The first performance tests shows that, as noted above, receiving large amounts of data using #upToAll: is greatly improved - factor of 10. Serving HTTP with small payloads seemed at first not be faster at all - but this is due to the high overhead of Socket connect/close and other things. Increasing payloads show a difference and especially with keep alive on - where the new SS roughly doubles the throughput!"			],			"category" : "Network-Kernel-Base"		},		"LayoutCell" : {			"hash" : 1838848,			"definition" : "Object subclass: #LayoutCell\r\tinstanceVariableNames: 'target cellSize extraSpace flags nextCell'\r\tclassVariableNames: ''\r\tpackage: 'Morphic-Base-Layouts'",			"comment" : [				"I am used in table layouts to hold temporary values while the layout is being computed.",				"",				"Instance variables:",				"\ttarget \t\t<Morph>\t\tThe morph contained in this cell",				"\tcellSize \t\t<Point>\t\tThe size of the cell",				"\textraSpace \t<nil | Point>\tAdditional space to add after this cell",				"\tnextCell \t<nil | LayoutCell>\tThe next cell in the arrangement.",				"",				"Implementation note:",				"Both, cellSize and extraSpace contains points where",				"\tx - represents the primary table direction",				"\ty - represents the secondary table direction"			],			"category" : "Morphic-Base-Layouts"		},		"AtomicQueueItem" : {			"hash" : 1091328,			"definition" : "Object subclass: #AtomicQueueItem\r\tinstanceVariableNames: 'next object'\r\tclassVariableNames: ''\r\tpackage: 'Collections-Atomic-Elements'",			"comment" : [				"I am a queue item, used by atomic queues.",				"All my new instances are circular i.e. next = self"			],			"category" : "Collections-Atomic-Elements"		},		"FLLargeIdentitySet" : {			"hash" : 558848,			"definition" : "FLLargeIdentityHashedCollection subclass: #FLLargeIdentitySet\r\tinstanceVariableNames: 'array includesNil'\r\tclassVariableNames: ''\r\tpackage: 'Fuel-Core-Collections'",			"comment" : [				"A LargeIdentitySet is an IdentitySet for large collections.",				"Rather than using linear probing, it takes advantage of the fact that identityHash (on a classic, 32bit VM) ",				"in Pharo only has 4096 unique values, using a bucket for each of those.",				"It will still work if hash range changes (ie buckets are chosen mod 4096), ",				"but the potential gain will be lower the more diverse the hash space is.",				"",				"With linear probing you risk an array looking like this:",				"Index:\tHash:",				"\t1\tX",				"\t2\tX",				"\t3\tX",				"\t4\t4",				"\t5\t5",				"\t6\t4",				"\t7\t4",				"\t8\t7",				"\t9\t6",				"\t10\tX",				"",				"While with buckets the same dataset looks:",				"Index:\tHash:",				"\t1\tX",				"\t2\tX",				"\t3\tX",				"\t4\t[4, 4, 4]",				"\t5\t5",				"\t6\t6",				"\t7\t7",				"\t8\tX",				"\t9\tX",				"\t10\tX",				"",				"So includes: can generally be done faster (also sped up byusing a special primitive), ",				"and removal of objects does not have to do extensive cleanup if object was part of a chain."			],			"category" : "Fuel-Core-Collections"		},		"RelationSet" : {			"hash" : 3455232,			"definition" : "Collection subclass: #RelationSet\r\tinstanceVariableNames: 'owner slot set'\r\tclassVariableNames: ''\r\tpackage: 'Slot-Examples-Associations'",			"comment" : [				"I'm a Set like collection that is used to hold collections of associated objects.
