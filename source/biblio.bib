 abstract = {Abstract Inspired by work of Ford, we describe a geometric representation of real and complex continued fractions by chains of horocycles and horospheres in hyperbolic space. We explore this representation using the isometric action of the group of Möbius transformations on hyperbolic space, and prove a classical theorem on continued fractions.},

abstract = {Abstract An algorithm for searching in a binary search tree using two-way comparisons is presented. The number of comparisons required by this algorithm is only one more than when using three-way comparisons. Since most high-level programming languages do not supply three-way comparisons, the number of comparisons used de facto is reduced by a factor of two. We give experimental results to indicate the speed-up that may be achieved by the presented algorithm.},

abstract = {Traits are a programming language technology that promote the reuse of methods between unrelated classes. This paper reports on a refactoring of the Smalltalk collections classes using traits. The original collection classes contained much duplication of code; traits let us remove all of it. We also found places where the protocols of the collections lacked uniformity; traits allowed us to correct these non-uniformities without code duplication.Traits also make it possible to reuse fragments of collection code outside of the existing hierarchy; for example, they make it easy to convert other collection-like things into true collections. Our refactoring reduced the number of methods in the collection classes by approximately 10 per cent. More importantly, understandability maintainability and reusability of the code were significantly improved.},
