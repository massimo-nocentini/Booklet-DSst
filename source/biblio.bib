 abstract = {Abstract Inspired by work of Ford, we describe a geometric representation of real and complex continued fractions by chains of horocycles and horospheres in hyperbolic space. We explore this representation using the isometric action of the group of Möbius transformations on hyperbolic space, and prove a classical theorem on continued fractions.},

abstract = {Abstract An algorithm for searching in a binary search tree using two-way comparisons is presented. The number of comparisons required by this algorithm is only one more than when using three-way comparisons. Since most high-level programming languages do not supply three-way comparisons, the number of comparisons used de facto is reduced by a factor of two. We give experimental results to indicate the speed-up that may be achieved by the presented algorithm.},
